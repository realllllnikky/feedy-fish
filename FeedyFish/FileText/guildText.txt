The rule is simple : 

EAT or BE EATEN

Start as a small fish, you will try to eat smaller fishes as fast as possible to get 
bigger in size
But be carefull, if bigger fishes catch you, they will eat you up ( :) )
So you have to be safe from there and try to survive longer
The largest fish is Shark (you can eat a shark)


Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your fish

Jellyfishes and crabs can hurt you and make you lose few points (-^-)
Gems drop from above can give you energy or 'lag' mode ><

If you get enough score, you win
Else you still win, but only bone!!

Good you luck !

	CHAPTER 1: Sandy Shoal
	Time to get your fins wet!

	Meet Buro the Clownfish. Buro lives in the warm waters of the Sandy 
	Shoal - a beautiful area off the Olso Coast. Enjoy the sights, but 
	don't get too comfortable... A fish still needs his lunch, and it's 
	a fish-eat-fish world out there! 


	How to play:
    	- Use your up, down, left, right arrow keys.
    	- Eat fish that are smaller than you.
    	- Avoid anything that's larger than you.
    	- Eat enough fish and you'll grow bigger!


	Okay, let's go!!

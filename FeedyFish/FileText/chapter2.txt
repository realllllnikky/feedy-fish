CHAPTER 2: Herring Herder
Bonus stage!

Oops!
What's this? You seem to have stumbled on a whole school
of herring, with no predators in sight! Better act fast!
Eat as many fish as you can in 100 seconds. Eat all fish 
before the timer runs out to rack up a Time Bonus at the
end of the Stage. And remember, DON'T TOUCH Jellyfish!

Try to eat many fish before the timer runs out.
